Changelog
=========


1.0.5 (2018-09-26)
------------------

Fixes:

- fix https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/2469:
  "Subobjects are indexing attributes of parent".
  Allow only direct attributes and acquired PythonScripts,
  but not acquired attributes.
  Indexers and PythonScripts are able to handle this explicitly,
  because they get the acquisition-wrapped object.

- Fix tests to work in Python 3

1.0rc2 - 2009-04-05
-------------------

- Added _getWrappedObject() method to get hold of the underlying object.

  [optilude]

- Corrected IZCatalog import location to point to the interfaces module.
  [hannosch]


1.0rc1 - 2009-03-26
-------------------

- Updated the interface to match the developments of similar functionality
  on CMF trunk. This means that indexers are now multi-adapters on
  (object, catalog), and the keyword arguments (including the implicit
  'portal' parameter) are gone.
  [optilude]

------------------
