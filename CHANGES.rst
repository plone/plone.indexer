1.0.7 (2020-04-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Minor packaging updates. (#1)


1.0.6 (2019-04-29)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Fixed: doctests on Python 2 were not correctly checked.  [maurits] (#7)


1.0.5 (2018-09-26)
------------------

Fixes:

- fix https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/2469:
  "Subobjects are indexing attributes of parent".
  Allow only direct attributes and acquired PythonScripts,
  but not acquired attributes.
  Indexers and PythonScripts are able to handle this explicitly,
  because they get the acquisition-wrapped object.

1.0rc2 - 2009-04-05
-------------------

- Added _getWrappedObject() method to get hold of the underlying object.

  [hannosch]


1.0rc1 - 2009-03-26
-------------------

- Updated the interface to match the developments of similar functionality

  'portal' parameter) are gone.
